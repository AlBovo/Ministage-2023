This repository contains all the websecurity CTF-style challenges for the ministages (events where last year middle school students visit high schools) of my school, prepared during the 2023/2024 school year.

## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/AlBovo/Ministage-2023.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd Ministage-2023
```

To initialize the Docker containers, Docker Compose files are available in every project folder.
Additionally, I have written `start.sh` and `stop.sh` scripts so that you can create the Docker containers more quickly

```bash
  ./start.sh
```
